			Over the years, terrorism has become a major international concern. There has been 1449 terrorist attacks reported in 2019 so far resulting in more than 6484 fatalities across the globe. In light of the global increase in the number and lethality of terrorist attacks, the activities of terrorists and terrorist groups have put every country at risk and therefore it has become imperative that nations, states, and private citizens become more involved in a strategic vision to recognize, prepare for, and if possible prevent such events. An efficient and user friendly system is required to analyze the vast amounts of data collected on terrorist activity across the world. Finding trends in the rate of attacks and activity of various terrorist groups over the years can provide valuable insight to both governments and civilians to be prepared and prevent future risk.

		<p style="font-size: 18px;font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px;" align="justify" >
			The Dataset includes information on terrorist events around the world since 1970 (currently updated through 2017). The databases includes systematic data on international as well as domestic terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes over 180,000 cases. For each terrorist incident, information is available on the date and location of the incident, the weapons used and nature of the target, the number of casualties, and -- when identifiable -- the identity of the perpetrator.

		<p style="font-size: 18px;font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px;" align="justify" >
			The Global Terrorism Index (GTI) is a comprehensive study analysing the impact of terrorism for 163
countries and which covers 99.7 per cent of the world’s population.Given the significant resources committed to counter terrorism
by governments across the world, it is important to analyse and
aggregate the available data to better understand its various
properties.</br></br>
Examples of the information contained in this study are:</br>
• The differing socio-economic conditions under which it
occurs.</br>
• The longer term trends and how terrorism changes over
time.</br>
• The geopolitical drivers associated with terrorism and
ideological aims of terrorist groups.</br>
• The types of strategies deployed by terrorists, their tactical
targets and how these have evolved over time.</br></br>
In this context, one of the key aims of the GTI is to examine
these trends. It also aims to help inform a positive, practical
debate about the future of terrorism and the required policy
responses.
The GTI is based on the Global Terrorism Database (GTD); the
most authoritative data source on terrorism today. The GTI
produces a composite score so as to provide an ordinal ranking
of countries on the impact of terrorism. The GTD is unique in
that it consists of systematically and comprehensively coded
data for 170,000 terrorist incidents.
